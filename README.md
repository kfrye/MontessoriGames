MontessoriGames
===============

This repository contains a series of simple games suitable for toddler-aged children. They are based upon activies that one might find in a Montessori school classroom, including:

    -- Matching tones
    -- Arranging tones in sequence
    -- Setting a clock to a particular time
    -- Reading the time from an analog clock
    -- Matching words written in cursive to pictures
    -- Counting numbers by grouping them by 5s, 10s, and 25s
    
The user is encouraged to learn more about Montessori by going to the Association Montessori International at:

Because the term Montessori was invalidated as a trademark by the US Patent office in 1967, the term can be freely used, and schools calling themselves "Montessori," especially those not recognized with AMI, may vary greatly. In general, the Montessori curriculum does not approve of children spending much time in front of screens, including computer screens, so the application should not be considered in any way endorsed by any Montessori authority. However, it is hoped that your child may get some enjoyment out of a simulation of a few of the activies that can be found in a typical Montessori classroom.
